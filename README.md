# rush-hour
Rush Hour is a sliding block puzzle where the goal is to get the goal car to the exit by moving the surrounding cars in a strictly linear fashion. Ultimately, this children game is a computational search problem and therefore can be solved using traditional search algorithms such as Breadth First Search and A*.
